Congratulations, you've now deployed an application to Kubernetes! Understanding what happened \u00b6 At its core, you can think of Kubernetes as being a highly-available database and a collection of watchers and controllers. Kubernetes objects and their required metadata, such as a name and their desired state, are stored in this database and the watchers and controllers act to ensure that the configuration of actual resources in the cluster matches the state stored in the database. Included in Kubernetes are a number of basic objects necessary for supporting applications as well as abstractions to simplify the configuration and management of applications. The most common basic object is a pod which encapsulates one or more containers along with storage resources, a unique network address and configuration options. The pod reflects the smallest unit of deployment. Although pods are technically transient, they will usually run until something destroys them, either a human operator or a controller. A Deployment is an abstraction that you can use to create a deployment of an application. It provides support for horizontally scaling pods, updating the container image used by the pods and also rollbacks. To create your application, you used the kubectl command to create a deployment object and provided a name for the deployment, \"guestbook\", and also the container image to use. These options were combined with defaults for the object to create the desired state that was stored in the database. Reconciliation of the desired state resulted in a single pod being started in the cluster. Then, you used the kubectl expose command to make the deployment resource accessible both inside and outside of the cluster. This command creates a Service for a number of different resource types (deployment, replica set, replication controler, pod) to allow access to a network port on the resource.

A key requirement of a container orchestration system is to automate the management steps of applications. Scaling up/down and handling application updates with support for rollback are a couple of essential use cases (but not the only ones). For this lab, you need a running deployment of the guestbook application from the previous lab. Scale apps with replicas \u00b6 A replica is a copy of a pod that contains a running service. By having multiple replicas of a pod, you can ensure your deployment has the available resources to handle increasing load on your application. kubectl provides a scale subcommand to change the size of an existing deployment. Let's increase our capacity from a single running instance of guestbook up to 10 instances using: kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment guestbook $ kubectl scale --replicas = 10 deployment guestbook deployment \"guestbook\" scaled If you remember back to the architecture overview in the previous exercise, the kubectl scale command updates the desired state in the etcd database in Kubernetes. The watchers and controllers will now try to make reality match the desired state of 10 replicas by starting 9 new pods with the same configuration as the first. To see your changes being rolled out, you can run: kubectl rollout status deployment guestbook The rollout might occur so quickly that you may only see deployment \"guestbook\" successfully rolled out for the output. $ kubectl rollout status deployment guestbook Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 of 10 updated replicas are available...

Kubernetes allows you to easily update the running image but also allows you to easily undo a rollout if a problem is discovered during or after deployment. In the previous lab, we used an image with a v1 tag. For our upgrade, we'll use the image with the v2 tag. To update and roll back: Using kubectl , you can now update your deployment to use the v2 image. kubectl allows you to change details about existing resources with the set subcommand. We can use it to change the image being used. kubectl set image deployment/guestbook guestbook=ibmcom/guestbook:v2 Note that a pod could have multiple containers, each with its own name. Each image can be changed individually or all at once by referring to the name. In the case of our guestbook Deployment, the container name is also guestbook . Multiple containers can be updated at the same time. ( More information .) Check the status of the rollout. The rollout might occur so quickly that you may only see deployment \"guestbook\" successfully rolled out for the output. kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook $ kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...

Remember, to get the \"nodeport\" and \"public-ip\" use: kubectl describe service guestbook and (replace mycluster below if you used a different name for your cluster): ibmcloud ks workers -c mycluster To verify that you're running \"v2\" of guestbook, press down shift while clicking on reload to discard the cached content and look at the title of the page, it should now be Guestbook - v2 If you want to undo your latest rollout, use: kubectl rollout undo deployment guestbook You can then use kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook to see the status. When doing a rollout, you see references to old replicas and new replicas. The old replicas are the original 10 pods deployed when we scaled the application. The new replicas come from the newly created pods with the different image. All of these pods are owned by the Deployment. The deployment manages these two sets of pods with a resource called a ReplicaSet. We can see the guestbook ReplicaSets with: kubectl get replicasets -l app=guestbook $ kubectl get replicasets -l app = guestbook NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE guestbook-5f5548d4f 10 10 10 21m guestbook-768cc55c78 0 0 0 3h Before we continue, let's delete the application so we can learn about a different way to achieve the same results by using resource files instead of providing command line options. To remove the deployment, use: kubectl delete deployment guestbook To remove the service,use: kubectl delete service guestbook Deeper dive on configuring resources \u00b6 Although it was convenient to create the guestbook deployment using the cli, in practice most applications and other kubernetes objects are created using configuration files in .yaml format. For example, the guestbook-deployment.yaml file is an example configuration file that would deploy the guestbook image with a total of 3 instances. This file shows the key parts needed for each kubenetes object. After the API version and resource type, there is a metadata section which specfies the name of the resource and a set of labels. Then, there is a spec section which defines the desired state. First, there's the definition of the replica set object for the deployment. Within the replica set , there is a template for the pod controlled by the set. Within this template, you can find labels applied at the pod level and the spec for the container(s) that will be deployed with each pod. In the last section of this lab, you will again deploy the guestbook application, along with other objects for a multi-tier application using resource files. After these are deleted, proceed to the next lab of this course","title":"Scale and Update Deployments"},{"location":"exercise-2/#scale-and-update-deployments","text":"In this lab, you'll learn how to update the number of instances in a deployment has and how to roll out an update of your application on Kubernetes with zero downtime.

This application uses the v2 version of the go application we used previously in the workshop as our web front end, and adds on 1) a Redis master for storage, 2) a replicated set of Redis slaves, and 3) a Python Flask application that calls the Watson Tone Analyzer service deployed in IBM Cloud. For all of these components, there are Kubernetes replication controllers, pods, and services. One of the main concerns with building a multi-tier application on Kubernetes, such as this one, is resolving dependencies between all of these seperately deployed components. In a multiple tier application, there are two primary ways that service dependencies can be resolved. The v2/guestbook/main.go code provides examples of each. For Redis, the master endpoint is discovered through environment variables. These environment variables are set when the Redis services are started, so the service resources need to be created before the guestbook replication controller starts the guestbook pods. For the analyzer service, an http request is made to a hostname, which allows for resource discovery at the time when the request is made. Consequently, we'll follow a specific order when creating the application components. First up, the Redis components will be created, then the guestbook application, and finally the analyzer microservice. Setup \u00b6 Continue by working in the web terminal. Change to the v2 folder where the deployment files reside: cd $HOME/digidevcon-iks/v2 Create the Redis master pod \u00b6 Use the redis-master-deployment.yaml file to create a replication controller and Redis master pod . The pod runs a Redis key-value server in a container. Using a replication controller is the preferred way to launch long-running pods, even for 1 replica, so that the pod inherits benefits from the self-healing mechanism in Kubernetes (i.e. keeps the pods alive). Use the redis-master-deployment.yaml file to create the Redis master deployment in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create -f redis-master-deployment.yaml $ kubectl create -f redis-master-deployment.yaml deployment.apps/redis-master created To verify that the redis-master controller is up, list the deployment and replicaset you created in the cluster with the kubectl get command (if you don't specify a --namespace , the current project/namespace will be used): kubectl get deploy this will show the current deployments in the namespace $ kubectl get deploy NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE redis-master 1/1 1 1 15s kubectl get replicaset this will show the current deployments in the namespace $ kubectl get replicaset NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE redis-master-7b7968db76 1 1 1 41s Result: The deployment creates the replicaset, which then creates the single Redis master pod. Verify that the redis-master pod is running, by listing the pods you created in cluster: kubectl get pods $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE redis-master-7b7968db76-8mjqg 1/1 Running 0 67s Result: You'll see a single Redis master pod (may take up to thirty seconds). Create the Redis master service \u00b6 A Kubernetes service is a named load balancer that proxies traffic to one or more pods. The services in a Kubernetes cluster are discoverable inside other pods via environment variables or DNS. Services find the pods to load balance based on pod labels. The pod that you created in previous step has the label app=redis and role=master . The selector field of the service determines which pods will receive the traffic sent to the service. Use the redis-master-service.yaml file to create the service in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create -f redis-master-service.yaml $ kubectl create -f redis-master-service.yaml service/redis-master created To verify that the redis-master service is up, list the services you created in the cluster: kubectl get services $ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kubernetes ClusterIP 172.21.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 8h redis-master ClusterIP 172.21.36.3 <none> 6379/TCP 10s ... Result: All new pods will see the redis-master service running on the host ( $REDIS_MASTER_SERVICE_HOST environment variable) at port 6379 , or running on redis-master:6379 . After the service is created, the service proxy on each node is configured to set up a proxy on the specified port (in our example, that's port 6379 ). Create the Redis slave pods \u00b6 The Redis master we created earlier is a single pod (REPLICAS = 1), while the Redis read slaves we are creating here are 'replicated' pods with 2 instances that will be started. In Kubernetes, a replication controller is responsible for managing the multiple instances of a replicated pod. Use the file redis-slave-deployment.yaml to create the replication controller: kubectl create -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml $ kubectl create -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml deployment.apps/redis-slave created To verify that the redis-slave controller is running: kubectl get rs $ kubectl get rs NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE redis-master-7b7968db76 1 1 1 2m48s redis-slave-6944587c87 2 2 2 36s Result: The deployment creates the replicaset, which then creates configures the Redis slave pods through the redis-master service (name:port pair, in our example that's redis-master:6379 ). Verify that the Redis master and slaves pods are running: kubectl get pods $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE redis-master-7b7968db76-8mjqg 1/1 Running 0 3m25s redis-slave-6944587c87-4gvgj 1/1 Running 0 73s redis-slave-6944587c87-h66wp 1/1 Running 0 73s ...

This application uses the v2 version of the go application we used previously in the workshop as our web front end, and adds on 1) a Redis master for storage, 2) a replicated set of Redis slaves, and 3) a Python Flask application that calls the Watson Tone Analyzer service deployed in IBM Cloud. For all of these components, there are Kubernetes replication controllers, pods, and services. One of the main concerns with building a multi-tier application on Kubernetes, such as this one, is resolving dependencies between all of these seperately deployed components. In a multiple tier application, there are two primary ways that service dependencies can be resolved. The v2/guestbook/main.go code provides examples of each. For Redis, the master endpoint is discovered through environment variables. These environment variables are set when the Redis services are started, so the service resources need to be created before the guestbook replication controller starts the guestbook pods. For the analyzer service, an http request is made to a hostname, which allows for resource discovery at the time when the request is made. Consequently, we'll follow a specific order when creating the application components. First up, the Redis components will be created, then the guestbook application, and finally the analyzer microservice.","title":"Deploy the Guestbook Application with the Tone Analyzer"},{"location":"exercise-5/#setup","text":"Continue by working in the web terminal.
